## 🧠 Overview

This project is based on the **[Databricks Academy Course – Get Started with AI Agents on Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/training/catalog/get-started-with-ai-agents-on-databricks-4464)**.
It introduces the core concepts, architecture, and practical development of **AI agents** — intelligent systems that can reason, plan, and act using foundation models.

Through a series of **interactive lectures, demos, and hands-on labs**, you’ll learn to:

* Understand what AI Agents are and how they differ from traditional AI systems
* Develop and prototype agents using **Mosaic AI**
* Evaluate and deploy AI Agents in **Databricks**
* Build **production-ready AI agents** with **Agent Bricks**

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you’ll be able to:

* Explain key **AI agent components** and **patterns**
* Build and prototype AI agents in **Mosaic AI Playground**
* Integrate tools and data sources with **Agent Bricks**
* Evaluate and deploy agents using **MLflow**
* Develop **production-grade AI agent applications** on Databricks
